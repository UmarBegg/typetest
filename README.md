# Umar's Typetest

This project is my attempt at creating a type test. The general idea is that it will (similar to many other tests), track your speed as you type and provide you with an average WPM (words per minute) score.

I am not using any tutorials for this and will try to logic my way through any problems! Wish me luck!

## Initial Plan

- I need random text to display. I may use a text generating API for this.

- I need an input box.

- I need a way to check each input character against the generated text characters.

- I need a way to track words and a place to store this.

- I need everything to stop running after 60 seconds

- I need to display words per minute.

- I will probably have to edit this plan as I go along.

- I will style everything after I am happy with the functionality I have created. I will probably use Tailwind CSS or
